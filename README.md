## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18+ — [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

### Install & Run

```bash
# 1. Clone / download the project
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd national-park-service-db

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start the server
npm start

# 4. Open in browser
open http://localhost:3000
```

The database (`nps.db`) is created automatically on first run with schema + sample data.

## 🗄️ Database Design

### Why SQLite instead of Azure SQL?

| | Azure SQL (original) | SQLite (this project) |
|---|---|---|
| Cost | Free trial (expires) | **Free forever** |
| Setup | Azure account required | Zero config, file-based |
| Local dev | Requires internet | Works offline |
| GitHub demo | Credentials expire | Just commit `nps.db` |

The schema is 100% faithful to the original — all tables, constraints, indexes, and relationships preserved. The only changes are SQLite-compatible syntax (e.g., `GETDATE()` → `date('now')`, computed columns removed in favor of `AS` expressions in queries).

### Entity–Relationship Overview

```
PERSON ──┬── VISITOR ──── ENROLL ──── PROGRAM ──── NATIONAL_PARK
         ├── RANGER ──┬── INCLUDES ── RANGER_TEAM ── REPORTS_TO ── RESEARCHER
         │            └── MENTORS
         ├── RESEARCHER ─ REPORTS_TO
         └── DONOR ──── DONATION ──┬── CREDIT_CARD_DONATION
                                   └── CHECK_DONATION

NATIONAL_PARK ── HOSTS ── CONSERVATION_PROJECT
PERSON ── PARK_PASS ── HOLDS
EMERGENCY_CONTACT → PERSON
```

### Tables (17 total)

| Table | Description |
|---|---|
| `PERSON` | Root entity — all people in the system |
| `EMERGENCY_CONTACT` | Multiple contacts per person |
| `VISITOR` | Specialization of PERSON |
| `RANGER` | Specialization of PERSON (w/ computed years_of_service) |
| `RESEARCHER` | Specialization of PERSON |
| `DONOR` | Specialization of PERSON |
| `DONATION` | Donation records (PK: person + date) |
| `CREDIT_CARD_DONATION` | Card payment details |
| `CHECK_DONATION` | Check payment details |
| `NATIONAL_PARK` | Park locations and capacity |
| `PROGRAM` | Park educational/recreational programs |
| `ENROLL` | Visitor–Program M:N with accessibility |
| `PARK_PASS` | Passes owned by persons |
| `HOLDS` | Person–Pass M:N relationship |
| `CONSERVATION_PROJECT` | Environmental projects |
| `HOSTS` | Park–Project M:N |
| `RANGER_TEAM` | Ranger team groups |
| `INCLUDES` | Ranger–Team M:N with leader flag |
| `MENTORS` | Ranger mentorship (1:1 each direction) |
| `REPORTS_TO` | Team–Researcher with date + description |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js + Express 4 + better-sqlite3
- **Database**: SQLite 3 (via better-sqlite3, no separate server needed)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (no framework dependencies)
- **Fonts**: DM Serif Display + Outfit + JetBrains Mono (Google Fonts)
- **Cost**: $0.00 — entirely free to run locally

## 📝 Original Project Notes

The original implementation used **Azure SQL Server** with a Java JDBC console application. This version:

1. Migrates the database to **SQLite** (free, file-based, zero config)
2. Replaces the Java CLI with a **modern web UI**
3. Adds a **REST API layer** for clean separation of concerns
4. Preserves **all original queries** (Q1–Q17) in the API
5. Adds **sample seed data** so the app is immediately usable
